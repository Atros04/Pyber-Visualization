# PyBer's Best Location Strategies

## Overview of Project

As we grow and look to expand operations, we need to find where out best course of expansion should be targeted toward. Using our customer's information and location analysis, we are going to find where we should focus our expansion efforts. To complete this analysis, we are going to utilize the charts and new summary information to target our expansion more accurately.

## Overview of the Results

Over 60% of our current distribution of riders and over 80% of our drivers are in urban areas. While the other 40% of riders and 20% of drivers are taken up by suburban and rural areas. Additionally, we see that our rural distribution of riders and drivers never goes above 10% despite those areas making the most money.

That being said, we currently have more drivers than rides taken in those urban areas at a rate of .67 rides per driver. While in suburban and rural areas, we have 1.27 and 1.60 riders per driver respectively. Our suburban and rural drivers make, on average, $20 more than their urban counterparts while only driving 2.7 to 13 times less.

We do see some trends over the first months of 2019 where fares were affected by what we can assume to be weather patterns in the areas of our service. We do have a lot of missing info here to make the best decisions, but we can assume based on the months of service and seasons therein.

## Results

Pyber is operating well for 2019. We had lots of usage throughout, but we were weak in the suburban and rural areas. This coming year is going to see some necessary changes in those areas. Our riders and drivers need to be marketed to in the rural regions especially as the lack of public transportation is felt across those regions. We should look to making the rural areas more readily availble with drivers especially in regional and cross-regional traffic. For example, drivers being able to take riders from one small rural region to another. Secondly, we need to look at limiting the new drivers for urban regions. at .67 rides per driver, competition is going to choke out new drivers looking to get into driving for us. Finally, we should look to bolstering our reach to suburban areas. We made twice as much money with 250% less rides than urban areas.
